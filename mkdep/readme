The Fortran dependency, call tree .and./.or. Makefile generator mkdep

Helge Avlesen <avle@bccs.uib.no>

This tool has two modes of usage: the simplified makefile approach,
and the project file approach.  The goal is to make it quick to set up
makefiles that handle complicated dependencies automatically, which
makes the use of modules much more convenient.


*The simplified Makefile approach

**Install:

First install mkdep in a convenient location. since you are now
already reading a readme file in this directory, do a

  python install.py

this will create a file called "rules" that we must include in all
Makefiles that want to use this system.

it is a good idea to have the mkdep directory first in your PATH,
e.g. with mkdep in your $HOME

  export PATH=~/mkdep:$PATH

**The makefile:

As a minimum, a Makefile to compile and link two sourcefiles
could look like these 3 lines

 SOURCEFILES= program.f90 module.f90
 FORTRANCOMPILER=g95
 include ../mkdep/rules

make sure the last line really points to the "rules" file, otherwise
things will not work! Now execute

    mkdep reset

To initialize the makefile.


(Sidetrack: if you omit e.g. FORTRANCOMPILER the tool will assume
FORTRANCOMPILER to be g95 by default.  it is also possible to specify
the name of the resulting executable in the EXECUTABLE variable.
these special variables has to be defined before the include
statement.)


Now, compiling the first time:
    make dep
    make

From then on, you can use a single "make" to rebuild, with two exceptions:
1) you modify SOURCEFILES below
2) you modify the code so that dependencies due to modules change.
in any of those cases, rebuild code with
    make dep
    make


*The project file approach

The user provides a "project file" that contains a list of all source
files that his program is made from. mkdep uses the project file to
create a list of object files and their dependencies in a form
suitable for inclusion in a Makefile. a simple template Makefile is
also created (Makefile.tmp). when the list of files in the project
file is changed, mkdep should be rerun (gmake dep). mkdep will only
reparse new or modified files, unless a file called
.mkdep_restart_file is deleted.

Example; 
if "ls *.f90" gives a complete list of source files for a program, and
we start in a directory without a Makefile and .o files, these three
commands are sufficient to build the executable using the g95 fortran
compiler:

  ls -1 *.f90 > files
  mkdep --fc g95 files
  gmake


* Installation and requirements

To make it work;
1) you need Python and GNU Make. (and of course a Fortran compiler to build)
2) ensure the mkdep files are in the $PATH.

For Windows users, go to the directory containing the mkdep scripts,
execute "install.py" and a set of .bat files should be produced.
make sure this directory is in the %path%. 

(The GNU make from e.g. http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/ works ok.)

For projects with a large number of object files, it may on some
systems be necessary to have the "ar" library tool available. ar is
invoked from the template Makefile if you use the -L option for
mkdep. The only difference to the template Makefile is in the final
link stage; if -L is used for mkdep, ar will be used to assemble the
object files into a big library in batches. This avoids getting into
problems with very long command lines in e.g. Windows and AIX.


* Basic usage and a description of the format for the project file

mkdep needs at least one argument: the name of a file which
contains a list of source files that you intend to use in the
project. the format of this file is simple:

1) if a line starts with a #, or is blank, it is ignored.

2) otherwise, in the first column on each line in the file,
   mkdep expects the full path to a source file, relative to the 
   current directory.

3) optionally, three other columns may be provided to override the default behaviour.
   mkdep will normally try to guess the file type based on the file name suffix;
  -column two is a user specified string that is used to group object files.
   the only restriction on the value of this string is the reserved group MAIN
   the one and only file in this group contains the main program.
   otherwise, the user may define as many groups as desired. these groups are made
   into Makefile variables that can be used later to compile object files with 
   different flags. if none of the files listed has the MAIN group, it
   is assumed that the main program is in the first file listed.
  -column three is a string (free format fortran, fixed format or C) to hint about 
   the language form. if this one is wrong, mkdep may fail to produce the correct 
   dependencies.
  -column four a string (source or include) to hint if the file is
   to be compiled or just "included". mkdep will not use include files in the list of
   object files.

To generate a list of source files, you can do something like

  ls -1 *.f90 > all.files

or, if the files are stored in a subdirectory tree, the more advanced

  find . \( -name "*.F" -o -name "*.F90" -o -name "*.h" -o -name "*.c" \) -print > all.files


Now, to generate dependencies for a Makefile, comment out stuff not
needed in the list of files, and feed the result into mkdep, e.g.:

  mkdep all.files

mkdep will warn if it finds duplicate file names, module definitions
and a few syntactical quirks it cannot handle.  A template Makefile
(Makefile.tmp) will be written in the current directory, as well
as a series of files which name start with .mkdep, see screen output
for what they contain. You can now edit the template Makefile and try
to build the program.

For a description of the other options to mkdep we refer to the
command line help

  mkdep -h



*Significance of the order of files

For very large projects, dependencies may be tricky to get right.
Fortran files may include files that use modules (that again can
include or use ...)  if a file is an included file, its source may
depend on e.g modules

   file.h : module1.o ...

If the same module is defined in multiple files, the actual source
file that will be used is the last one listed in the project file.

Similarly for multiply defined include files: the last file in the
project file will be used by default. The search order may be
overridden through the use of -I flags in the makefile, or by
providing a list of include directories to search via the -i argument
to mkdep. the last directories in the list will be the first in the
search list.

an example of how to "manually" produce a template list of directories

  cat files2.map | awk '{print $1}' | grep -i -e "[.]h" | sed 's/\/[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[.][Hh]//' | sort | uniq


*Making a call tree

The command

  mkdep --treetop SUPERBEE -t "A test tree" files.txt

will generate a call tree from the files in files.txt, but only with
routines called from SUPERBEE. The tree will be written to a file
called "A test tree.html" that can be opened in a browser, and also a
ascii file called .mkdep.tree

The parser does not support many Fortran 9x features yet, such as
correct handling of nested name spaces, but it should still generate
trees that are "close" to correct in some sense.


*Shortcomings

mkdep currently first joins all continuated lines, then split these
lines at ";"'s, and then empties all strings before searching for use
or include statements. mkdep will get problems if continuation is used
across c preprocessing #ifdef regions.
